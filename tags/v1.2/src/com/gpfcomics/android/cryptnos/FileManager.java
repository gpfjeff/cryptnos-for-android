/* FileManager.java

 * PROGRAMMER:    Jeffrey T. Darlington
 * DATE:          November 4, 2010
 * PROJECT:       Cryptnos (Android)
 * ANDROID V.:	  1.1
 * REQUIRES:      
 * REQUIRED BY:   
 * 
 * The FileManager class was added in Cryptnos 1.2.0 to hopefully abstract the
 * process of using third-party file management applications for selecting import
 * files and export paths.  By pulling this into its own class, we can hopefully
 * add and remove file managers with relative ease.  This class will take care of
 * the process of detecting what recognized file managers are available and
 * maintaining the user's preference of which file manager to use.  Note that
 * only the file managers explicitly choose to support will be available, and we
 * can only use those that publish the necessary data and Intents to make these
 * selections possible.
 * 
 * For the initial release, we will support OI File Manager from OpenIntents and
 * AndExplorer, as these are the only file managers that we know about with
 * published Intents.

/**
 * This class abstracts third-party file manager applications and provides us with a
 * wrapper for dealing with them.  Cryptnos can use these file managers for selecting
 * files and folders/directories during the import and export processes.  It only
 * knows about specific file managers whose Intents we know how to call, but should
 * provide sufficient abstraction to allow new file managers to be added over time
 * as new Intents are discovered.
