<string name="help_back_prompt"><i>Tap <b>Back</b> to return to the previous screen.\n</i></string>
<string name="help_text_whatis"><b>Cryptnos</b> is a small utility for generating strong, unique, yet repeatable passwords using cryptographic hashes. Its original intended use was for website authentication, but it can be used for any purpose where strong passwords are required or encouraged. <b>Cryptnos</b> combines an easy-to-remember token with a secret phrase known only to the user, then passes both to a selectable cryptographic hash to generate a password that is seemingly random, difficult to brute-force, and impossible to regenerate without knowing both the token and the original secret.\n\n<b>Cryptnos</b> is not a password vault. It <i><u>NEVER</u></i> stores your master or generated passwords; it only stores the parameters necessary to recreate the password, excluding your master password. All information is stored in an encrypted form that should be difficult to reverse engineer if your device is somehow compromised.\n\nOne common problem faced by users today is password security. As we begin using more and more online services, we are faced with an exponential growth in the number of passwords we have to maintain. For the best level of security, these passwords should be as long and complex as possible, using many different types of characters, and each password should be unique for each site. Realistically, the vast majority of users won\'t follow this advice. They will pick something simple, short, and easy to guess, and to make matters worse, they will likely reuse the same password over and over again. This not only makes one account easy for attackers to compromise, but compromising one account could mean many are at risk.\n\nOne solution that has been introduced are utilities that combine the domain name of a given site with a master password, then pass that combined value through a cryptographic hash to generate a pseudo-random password. The advantage to this system is that it produces relatively strong \"passwords\" that are unique for each site. The user only needs to memorize their master password, while gaining the benefits of strong, unique passwords for each site.\n\nMost of these utilities have a number of caveats, however. Firstly, almost all of them exist as browser plugins; this works great when you are using that particular browser at that particular computer, but it\'s useless outside the browser or, worse, when you\'re on the go with your mobile device.\n\nSecondly, the choice of the domain name as the unique token is usually automatic and cannot be configured; again, this is tied to the browser-centric design of these utilities.\n\nThirdly, many of these apps use the MD5 cryptographic hash as the engine for producing the final password. While this has worked relatively well so far, it should be noted that the MD5 hash is no longer considered secure for its intended purpose. Therefore it would be wise not to use it for secondary purposes such as password generation. Similarly, the SHA-1 hash, which is generally considered stronger than MD5, has also shown weakness to specific attacks. While it is unrealistic to assume than any given hash is invulnerable to attack, there are much stronger alternatives available than these two.\n\nFourth, most of these password generating utilities encode their output in hexadecimal format. While this is certainly better from the standpoint of appearing more random, it is actually weaker per character than choosing a dictionary word with mixed case. Hexadecimal only has 16 possible values per character. If these utilities used a more compact encoding such as Base64, they could obtain higher entropy (or strength per character); in the case of Base64, that would be 65 permutations per character (assuming you include the padding character, which is usually the equal sign). Even if you strip some of the non-alphanumeric symbols (i.e., anything that is not a letter or number), you would get an entropy of 62, a difference of 46 permutations per character over hexadecimal. Considering that this is a massive exponential increase in security, this upgrade should be obvious.\n\nFifth, none of these utilities take into account the fact that many sites have additional restrictions, such as limiting the types of characters (like only letters and numbers) or the length of the password. It is possible, of course, to modify the password after it has been generated, but then the user must make the extra effort to remember what modifications have been made. If the user cannot be bothered to produce distinct passwords per site already, it is unlikely they will do so here.\n\n<b>Cryptnos</b> ups the ante by approaching each of these issues head-on. Cryptnos exists as its own application, making it usable outside of any given browser. You can simply copy the generated password into any field where it is required. The site token <i>can</i> be a domain name, but it doesn\'t have to be; it can be whatever the user wants, so long as it is unique from every other site saved in the database. <b>Cryptnos</b> also gives you incredible flexibility by letting you configure which cryptographic hash to use, how many iterations of that hash should be performed, what types of characters to include, and the length of the final password. It also encodes its output in Base64, producing up to 65 distinct character options per digit.\n\nBest of all, <b>Cryptnos</b> remembers all of these details for you, so you don\'t have to worry about it. You just have to enter your parameters once; the next time you need your password, simply select the site token from the list and everything except your master password will be filled in for you. These parameters are stored in the database in an encrypted format, meaning that even if an attacker steals your device, they cannot access this information unless the device is unlocked. Even then, your final password is safe so long as your master password remains a secret, since it is never stored.</string>
<string name="help_text_start">To begin using <b>Cryptnos</b>, start by selecting the <b>Generate new password</b> option in the main menu. You will be presented with a form with two mandatory and several optional parameters:\n\nThe <b>Site token</b> is a unique mnemonic to identify where you intend to use the password. An obvious choice might be a website domain name, but it doesn\'t have to be. It can be anything you want, so long as it is unique and descriptive. Your <b>Master Password</b> is a secret known only to you which is never recorded. Ideally, it too should be unique, but you can safely use the same master password for every site since the final password is all the authenticating site will ever see. At a minimum, these two required fields will be combined to generate your password.\n\nThe <b>Hash algorithm</b> is a cryptographic digest. The site token and secret will be combined, converted to raw binary data, then passed through this algorithm to produce a pseudo-random result. Which algorithm you choose is entirely up to you, but the stronger the algorithm, the better and longer your final password will become. The hashes MD5 and SHA-1 are included for historical and convenience value, but are not recommended because they have recently been shown to be susceptible to attack. You can force <b>Cryptnos</b> to perform the hash multiple times by specifying a value in the <b>Number of hash iterations</b> box. This must be a whole number greater than zero (i.e. positive integers), with a default of 1. Note that a higher number of iterations may take longer for <b>Cryptnos</b> to generate your password, but it will be further removed from the original inputs and theoretically stronger as a result. The maximum number of iterations is currently capped at 500 for performance reasons, although this is should be more than enough for most use cases.\n\nSome websites and applications restrict the types of characters you can use in your password. <b>Cryptnos</b> uses Base64 to encode the output of the cryptographic hash, which may result in some symbol characters that these sites may reject. You can have <b>Cryptnos</b> take care of this for you by specifying the <b>Character restrictions</b> on the final output. If at all possible, we recommend you use all generated characters (including symbols), but if you are required to use only certain characters, <b>Cryptnos</b> can strip out those you cannot use. You can have it change all symbols to underscores, strip out all non-alphanumerics (i.e., only return letters and numbers), use only letters, or even use only numbers. Bear in mind that any time you limit the number of character options available for your password, you lessen the entropy of the final password, making it slightly weaker and more vulnerable to attack.\n\nSimilarly, many passwords are restricted in length, usually because the service you are authenticating with only has a limited amount of space allocated to store each password. You can have <b>Cryptnos</b> trim the generated password to the desired length by specifying the <b>Length restrictions</b> you require. This drop-down list defaults to a value of \"None\", indicating no restriction will be applied, followed by positive integers (i.e. whole numbers) ranging from 1 to the maximum length of the generated hash string. The list of numbers changes dynamically when the hash algorithm selection changes. If you specify a length restriction and then change algorithms to a hash that is shorter than the chosen length limit, the restriction will automatically be reset to \"None\".\n\nNote that your final password <i>may</i> be shorter than the limit you specify if other parameters reduce the length of the generated password below the chosen limit. For example, the chosen character restriction may remove so many characters from the generated password that it may be shorter than the limit you set here. Keep in mind that in general, the longer a password is, the stronger it is, so always try to make your password as long as you possibly can. If the service you wish to authenticate with specifies a range of lengths (i.e. \"between 8 and 12 characters\"), always specify the maximum value of this range to get the highest level of security.\n\nOnce you have entered all your parameters, tap the <b>Generate</b> button to generate your new password. As soon as the password has been created, it will be copied to the system clipboard so you can paste it into whatever form that may require it, assuming you have this setting enabled. (You can enable or disable this functionality in the Advanced Settings menu.) In addition, your parameters for generating the password (except for your master secret) will be saved to an encrypted database on your device.\n\nNow that you have your new password, you can move to your browser or another application to use it, or you can remain on the <b>Generate new password</b> to create additional new passwords. You may reuse the form as many times as you like, so long as you make sure to enter a new site token and tap the <b>Generate</b> button for each new set of parameters. If you do not change the site token, the new set of parameters will overwrite the existing parameters in the database, so be careful.\n\nTapping <b>Back</b> from this screen will return you to the main menu.</string>
<string name="help_text_existing">After you have generated your first set of parameters, you can regenerate your password from your existing parameters by selecting <b>Generate existing password</b> from the main menu. You will then be presented with a list of all your saved site tokens; tap the desired site in the list to move to the next step. You will be given with a simplified form that displays your parameters in read-only format and prompts you for your master secret. Tapping <b>Generate</b> here will regenerate your password as before (and copy it to the clipboard if that setting is enabled), but will not modify any of the information in the database. Note that this option lets you recreate your password safely without the danger of accidentally changing your parameters. Once you have created your site parameters with the <b>Generate new password</b> option, use this option for day-to-day use. Tapping <b>Back</b> from this screen will take you back to the main menu.\n\nIf you ever need to edit a set of parameters, select <b>Edit existing parameters</b> from the main menu, then tap the desired site token from the list. You will get the same form as when you first created the parameters, except that the site token will be locked so it cannot be changed. Tapping <b>Generate</b> here will regenerate the password, update the parameters in the database, and optionally copy the new password to the clipboard. Once you are done editing, tap <b>Back</b> to return to the main menu.\n\nIf you ever need to delete a set of parameters, select <b>Delete parameters</b> from the main menu and select the site token from the list. You will be asked to confirm the action before the parameters for that site will be deleted. If you confirm the action, the selected set of parameters will be removed from the database and the site token list will be refreshed. Tapping <b>Back</b> here will return you back to the main menu.\n\nAny time the site token list is displayed, you can also long-press any site token to get a pop-up context menu that offers all three of these options. Thus, if you accidentally tapped <b>Edit existing parameters</b> when you meant to tap <b>Generate existing password</b>, you can simply long-press the token you want to generate and tap <b>Generate password</b> in the pop-up to be taken to the generate-only screen.</string>
<string name="help_text_importexport"><b>Cryptnos</b> includes the functionality to export and import site parameters. Exports can be useful as a means of backing up your parameter data as a precaution against disastrous data loss. They can also be helpful in situations where you might want to copy parameter data from one device running <b>Cryptnos</b> to another, such as if you acquire a new handset or if you wish to share a login with a spouse or trusted colleague. You may choose to export any number of sites from your database, from one to all of them. The import function will only import data created by the export function from a compatible version of <b>Cryptnos</b>.\n\nThe exact import/export mechanisms available depend on the capabilities of your device and may be enhanced by the presence of some third-party applications.\n\n<b>Exporting Parameters to a File</b>\n\n<b>Cryptnos</b> can export one or more sets of parameters to an encrypted file on your device\'s mass storage. If there are no parameters saved in the <b>Cryptnos</b> database or no mass storage area is available and writable, the ability to export to a file will be disabled.\n\nTypically, mass storage consists of either an internal, built-in media storage location or a removable storage device such as an SD or microSD card. Some devices may contain more than one mass storage area; in these situations, one is typically designated by the operating system as a default. <b>Cryptnos</b> reads and writes to the default mass storage area unless explicitly instructed otherwise, so it may be a good idea to identify which storage area is the default before attempted to export or import data. <b>Cryptnos</b> can read and write to non-default mass storage, but this functionality requires th presence of a compatible third-party file manager application.\n\nTo export a set of parameters, select <b>Export</b> from the main menu. If a pop-up menu appears prompting you to <b>Export To</b>, select <b>File</b>. The export form contains either five or six controls, depending on the capabilities of the device as detected when the form loads:\n\nIf a compatible third-party file manager is installed and you have set a preference for it in the Advanced Settings activity, a <b>Selected Path</b> button will appear first. Tapping this button will launch your preferred file manager to help you select a path (i.e. folder or directory) to save your export file in. The default path will be the root (i.e. top level) of your default mass storage area. Note that this function will only let you select <i>folders,</i> since you are specifying the export path. (The file name will be specified below.) If your device supports multiple mass storage areas you can select which mass storage area to save to through the interface provided by your file manager.\n\nIf you do not have a compatible file manager installed or no preference has been sent, the <b>Selected Path</b> button will not appear. Instead, you will be forced to save your export file in the root of the default mass storage area. If your device supports multiple mass storage areas <b>Cryptnos</b> will save the file to whichever is the default storage area for your device. To change this behavior, you must install a recognized file manager application.\n\nThe first text box contains the name of the export file you wish to create. You may name your file whatever you wish, so long as it is a valid file name for the file system on your mass storage. By default, <b>Cryptnos</b> will name the file based on the current date and time. If you prefer to change this name to something else, feel free to do so by editing the value of this field. The file you specify will be created in the folder specified by the <b>Select Path</b> button, or the root of your default mass storage if it is unavailable. If you specify the name of a file that already exists, <b>Cryptnos</b> will warn you that the file will be overwritten if you continue.\n\nThe next two text boxes will contain your encryption password, which must be entered twice, once in each box, to protect against typing errors. This password is not the same as your master password; in fact, it is strongly recommended that you use a <i>different</i> password than your master one, to protect it from potential attack. However, <b>Cryptnos</b> will accept whatever you enter into these fields. Your password will be combined with a salt to generate a strong, pseudo-random password that will be used to encrypt the export file. Keep track of this password because it will be required whenever you import the file later, and a forgotten password cannot be recovered.\n\nThe next control is the <b>Pick sites to export...</b> button. Tap this button to see a list of all site tokens in the database. Each token will have a checkbox next to it. You may pick and choose any site you wish, but you will need to select at least one to continue with the export. Once you have selected the sites you wish to export, tap <b>OK</b>. As a convenience, there are two other buttons in this dialog: the <b>Select All</b> button will check all the checkboxes and thus select all the sites, while the <b>Clear All</b> button will clear all the checkboxes, effectively selecting nothing. Both of these buttons will also close the site list dialog. A brief pop-up message will indicate the number of sites currently selected.\n\nOnce you have entered all of your export parameters, tap the <b>Export</b> button to export the parameters. A brief dialog will appear showing the export progress. Once the export is complete, another message will appear indicating success or failure. You will then be returned to the <b>Cryptnos</b> main menu.\n\n<b>Exporting Parameters to a QR Code</b>\n\nIf you have installed one or more recognized third-party applications that can generate QR codes, tapping <b>Export</b> on the main menu may display a pop-up dialog asking where you would like to <b>Export To</b>. If you select <b>QR Code</b>, the site list will appear, just as if you were selecting a site to edit or delete. Tapping a site name will fetch its parameters from the database and launch your preferred QR code generating app. A two-dimensional bar code called a QR code will be displayed. You may then use this image to import the site into a compatible version of <b>Cryptnos</b> on another device as described below.\n\nNote that if you long-press a site name in the site list, a new option called <b>Export via QR code</b> may appear. This option performs the same task and is available regardless of which main menu option your originally selected.\n\nAlso note that <b>Cryptnos</b> can only export one set of parameters at a time via QR code. If you plan to export a large number of sites at once, it may be more time efficient to use the file-based export process rather than to export via QR code.\n\n<b>Importing Parameters from a File</b>\n\n<b>Cryptnos</b> can import one or more sets of parameters from an encrypted file on your device\'s mass storage. If no mass storage area is available and readable, the ability to import from a file will be disabled.\n\nImporting parameters into <b>Cryptnos</b> is just as easy as exporting. Tap <b>Import</b> from the main menu to initiate the process. If more than one import option is available, you may see a pop-up box asking you to select an import method (<b>Import From</b>). To import from a file, <b>Cryptnos</b> must be able to read from your mass storage area. To import from a QR code, a recognized QR code scanner must be installed on the device.\n\nIf you choose to import from a file, the import form will contain the following controls:\n\nIf a compatible file manager is installed and its preference set, the <b>Selected File</b> button will launch the file manager to help you select your import file. This file can be anywhere on your mass storage device. If you have more than one mass storage area, you can use the file manager to navigate to the appropriate one. When you return to <b>Cryptnos</b>, the button text will be updated to include the path to the currently selected file.\n\nIf no compatible file manager is available or no preference has been set, a drop-down list of all readable files on the root of your default mass storage area will be displayed instead. It will not contain folders or any files which <b>Cryptnos</b> cannot read. If <b>Cryptnos</b> cannot find any suitable files, the rest of the form will be hidden and an error message will be displayed. To select a file from the drop-down, tap it and select the desired file from the resulting list. If the file you want is not listed, then it may not be readable or may not be in the root of your mass storage area. If you have more than one mass storage area, it may be on the secondary, non-default one. You will need to exit <b>Cryptnos</b> and check on the status of the file in your favorite file manager utility before proceeding. If necessary, move the file from its current location to the root of your default mass storage device. Once you have verified that the file is present and readable, return to <b>Cryptnos</b> and try the import again.\n\nBelow the file box will be a password text box. You must enter the same password here that you used to export the parameters earlier.\n\nOnce you have specified the file name and password, tap the <b>Import</b> button to begin the import process. <b>Cryptnos</b> will attempt to open and read the file and decrypt its contents. If any sort of error occurs, a brief message will be displayed. If the file is decrypted and read successfully, a dialog box will appear listing the names of the sites read from the file. Just like the dialog mentioned above to select which sites to export, this dialog will allow you to select which sites from the file you would like to import. You may select each individually or tap <b>Select All</b> to select all of them at once. Tapping Cancel will abort the entir eimport process and return you to the main menu.\n\nIf none of the selected sites from the import file will overwrite any existing sites in the database, the sites will be immediately imported and you will be returned to the main menu. A pop-up message will display the number of sites successfully imported. If, however, at least one imported site will overwrite an existing site, a dialog box will warn you of this fact. You may decide to proceed with the import or cancel. If you proceed, all imported sites that will overwrite an existing site will be imported. If you cancel, the import will be aborted. Either way, you will be returned to the main menu.\n\nPrior to <b>Cryptnos</b> 1.1, export files for the various platforms <b>Cryptnos</b> runs on were platform specific. This has been improved in <b>Cryptnos</b> 1.1 and later. Starting with this version, <b>Cryptnos</b> will export parameters in a new cross-platform format that can be read by compatible versions of <b>Cryptnos</b> on any platform. Thus, you can create a new set of parameters on one platform, export them to an encrypted file, and import them into the instance of <b>Cryptnos</b> on another platform. This does mean, however, that export files from <b>Cryptnos</b> 1.1 and later are not backward compatible with <b>Cryptnos</b> 1.0. However, all later versions of <b>Cryptnos</b> can still import <b>Cryptnos</b> 1.0 export files generated on the same platform, so your old backup files will still be valid.\n\n<b>Importing Parameters from QR Code</b>\n\nIf you select <b>QR Code</b> from the <b>Import From</b> dialog, <b>Cryptnos</b> will launch your preferred QR code scanning application. Point your device\'s camera toward a QR code generated by a compatible version of <b>Cryptnos</b> on another device and the scanner will attempt to read it. If successful, <b>Cryptnos</b> will then check to see if the imported site will overwrite an existing site in the database. If so, it will ask you whether or not you would like to overwite the existing site. If you say yes or if the imported site will not overwrite an existing one, the new site will be immediately imported into the database and a success message will appear over the main menu screen. If you decide not to overwrite an existing site or if the scan fails for some reason, an error message will be displayed.\n\nNote that <b>Cryptnos</b> can only import one set of parameters at a time via QR code. If you plan to import a large number of sites at once, it may be more time efficient to use the file-based import process rather than to import via QR code.\n\n<b>Backup, Backup, Backup!</b>\n\nRegardless of the import method used, it is always a good idea to perform a full export of <i>all</i> sites in your database as a backup anytime you make a change. You should then copy this export file off of your device and place it in a secure location. If your device is ever stolen or <b>Cryptnos</b> is accidentally uninstalled, having a backup will help you recover you site parameters quickly.</string>
<string name="help_text_settings"><b>Cryptnos</b> provides a series of advanced setting options that allow you to modify how it works under the hood.\n\nThe <b>Copy Generated Passwords to Clipboard</b> checkbox lets you enable or disable this feature. When enabled, passwords generated by the Generate Existing and Generate New Password activities as well as the Edit Existing Parameters activity will be immediately copied to the Android system clipboard once they are generated. This allows you to paste the generated password into whatever authentication form you require. If this option is disabled, passwords will be generated by these activities but they will not be copied to the clipboard; you will either need to copy them yourself or manually type them into the appropriate form. By default, <b>Cryptnos</b> has this option enabled as a convenience. Note that copying passwords to the clipboard may be a security risk and you should always copy some other data to the clipboard after you have used your password to ensure that the password no longer remains in memory after it is no longer needed.\n\nThe <b>Show Master Passwords</b> checkbox changes the behavior of all master and import/export encryption password boxes. By default, this box is unchecked, meaning that the master password text boxes on the Generate Existing, Generate New, and Edit Existing activities will obscure the contents of the password to prevent someone from seeing it over your shoulder. Similarly, the encryption password fields in both the import and export activities will also be obscured. If this checkbox is turned on, a warning dialog will be displayed to notify you that turning this feature on may pose a security risk. Should you decide to continue, this feature will then be turned on and all of the password fields mentioned above will display their passwords in plain text. Some users find this more convenient, especially if their master and encryption passwords are very long and complex. Clearing this checkbox restores the default behavior and obscures all master and encryption passwords throughout the application.\n\nThe <b>Text Encoding</b> drop-down list provides a means to change what text or character encoding is used by <b>Cryptnos</b> when it coverts your site token and master password into binary data to generate your password. Text encodings determine how human-readable text gets translated into the binary numbers that computers understand and vice versa. Cryptographic hashes only work on binary data, so your text parameters must be converted to binary before they can be hashed. Due to technical, cultural, and historical reasons, there are dozens if not hundreds of text encodings in the computerized world, many of which are subtly if not significantly different. If your Android device uses one text encoding while your desktop computer uses another, the versions of <b>Cryptnos</b> on these different platforms may produce very different results, making the passwords they generate incompatible.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that all users use the UTF-8 text encoding for <b>Cryptnos</b> if at all possible. UTF-8 is backward compatible with historically significant character sets such as US ASCII, but allows for expansion to include non-American English characters. Based on our limited testing, this appears to be the default for most \"vanilla\" or \"standard\" versions of Android, i.e. versions produced directly by Google and released to handset manufacturers. However, some users have experienced situations where non-standard, modified versions of Android (\"mods\", \"roots\", or \"ROMs\") may use different default text encodings. It is also possible that older desktop versions of <b>Cryptnos</b> (either for Windows or Java) may use other character sets, and you may wish to change the text encoding used <b>Cryptnos</b> for Android to match the encoding used by that version. We strongly recommend that all versions of <b>Cryptnos</b> be set to UTF-8 for the greatest compatibility, but as long as all platforms you intend to use match then your passwords should match also.\n\nThis text encoding setting is used only for the generation of passwords. The import/export mechanism of <b>Cryptnos</b> has always used UTF-8 for encoding and thus will not be affected when this setting is changed. Thus, it is strongly recommended that you export your parameter data to a backup file before making this change. You may have to export your sites, delete your parameter data, change the text encoding, and re-import your parameters in order to effectively make this change.\n\nThe settings activity also allows you to specify a preferred file manager for selecting import files and export paths. If no recognized file managers are installed or no preference is set, <b>Cryptnos</b> will only read and write these files to the root of your default mass storage area (either an internal media storage area or perhaps an SD or microSD card). If you install a third-party file manager application that <b>Cryptnos</b> recognizes, you can specify your preference to use it here and the Import and Export activities will be enhanced to use your preferred file manager when selecting import files or export paths. This gives you the freedom to place your files wherever you wish on your mass storage, rather than be constrained to a single location.\n\nNote that only select file manager applications are currently recognized. These are applications that (a) publish public \"intents\" that allow third-party apps (like <b>Cryptnos</b>) to use them for selecting files and folders, and (b) we know about their existence. If your current favorite file manager is not recognized and you know its developer has published intents for file selection, please let the <b>Cryptnos</b> team know about it and we\'ll try to add it. If the file manager does not publish intents and you\'d like to use it with <b>Cryptnos</b>, please contact its developer first and ask them to publish these intents, then contact us to have it added.\n\nIf something happens to make your preferred file manager selection no longer valid, such as the selected file manager has been uninstalled, <b>Cryptnos</b> will revert to its original behavior and will only allow reading and writing to the root of the default mass storage device. If you reinstall the file manager or install a different one, you will need to return to the settings activity to set your new file manager preference.\n\nIf you have installed one or more recognized applications that can scan and generate QR codes, <b>Cryptnos</b> will also gain the ability to export and import site parameters via QR code. As with the file manager selection, only certain bar code scanners are recognized and supported. If at least one scanner is detected, it will immediately become the default. If more than one app is detected, you may select your preference from the provided drop-down list. If you uninstall the scanner app that is currently selected as the preferred one, <b>Cryptnos</b> will check to see if another scanner is still installed. If another scanner is found, it will be immediately selected; if no scanners are found, QR code support will become disabled.\n\nIf no supported file managers or QR code scanners are found, the settings activity will display a list of the third-party applications it recognizes. You can then search for these applications by name in the Android Market or on the Web to learn how to install them.</string>
<string name="help_text_disclaimers">Please read the <b>Cryptnos</b> license for complete licensing information. <b>Cryptnos</b> is released under the GNU General Public License version 2, which outlines information concerning its use, redistribution, and warranties. Please read this license fully before using this application.\n\nSince <b>Cryptnos</b> is designed to generate strong, pseudo-random passwords, security should be a paramount concern for both you and us. It would be safe to assume that if you\'re considering <b>Cryptnos</b> for your password generation needs, you likely have deep concern for the protection of your data and account credentials. Fortunately, <b>Cryptnos</b> is right behind you, protecting your data as best it can.\n\nWhenever possible, <b>Cryptnos</b> encrypts any data it stores to protect its contents. For saved parameter information, site tokens are hashed using a one-way, irreversible cryptographic hash algorithm to prevent the token from being guessed by just looking at the database. This hash includes your device\'s unique system ID as part of the salt, meaning that the hash value will be unique for every device. When the site parameters are stored in the database, they are encrypted using 256-bit AES encryption and stored as a binary \"blob\" of data. The parameters cannot be recovered without incredible brute-force attacks.\n\nDuring export to a file, site parameters are again encrypted using AES, this time keyed to a password entered by the user during the export process. The same password is required during import, protecting the data from unauthorized access. The password used for export and import is <i>never</i> saved. However, parameters exported and imported via QR code are <b><i>NOT</i></b> encrypted, and QR codes can be scanned by any application or device that can see the generated code. Care should be taken when exporting and importing via QR code to ensure that no one can see the generated code while the transfer takes place.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that in all cases, any time the site parameters are stored, the user\'s master password is <b><i>NEVER</i></b> stored. The master password will <b><i>NEVER</i></b> be stored in the application database, encrypted export files, or generated QR codes. Thus, even if an attacker somehow managed to break the encryption protecting your parameter data, they would never have <i>all</i> of the elements required to generate the final password. As such, the master password becomes the most import part of your parameter information and should be the most closely guarded. It should never be written down or stored anywhere, and you should be wary of potential social engineering attacks by which an attacker may trick or coerce you into revealing your password.\n\nFor the <i>extremely</i> paranoid, you should never use the generated password <i>exactly</i> as it appears. You can add yet another layer of security by slightly modifying the generated password before using it for authentication. For example, you could generate a password and then transpose the first three characters, rotating them so the second becomes the first, the third becomes the second, and the first becomes the third. Then if an attacker somehow managed to break all the layers of encryption protecting your parameters as well as socially engineer your master password from you, they will not be able to use any generated passwords as-is. Such an added step may seem pointless or cumbersome to some, but it definitely adds another layer of complexity that vastly improves the overall security of your logins.\n\n<b>Cryptnos</b> should never be used to generate passwords on a device which you do not control or trust. Any device can be compromised by viruses, trojans, keyloggers, or any number of other forms of malware. Keyloggers can scan everything you type, including your master password. Some malware take screenshots of items on the screen, which may include your site token and your generated password. Any program that compromises the system memory can read the memory addresses of other programs, which may include any site token, master password, or generated password used by <b>Cryptnos</b>. And while a security conscious user can take plenty of precautions to ensure that their own system remains secure, you should <i>never</i> trust a device that you cannot guarantee its security.\n\nSerious crypto-heads should take note that the AES encryption used by <b>Cryptnos</b> uses an initialization vector (IV) that is programmatically generated rather than being truly random. There are two reasons for this decision. Firstly, with respect to saving the site parameters to the database, the IV would need to be stored somewhere on the device in order for it to be used later to retrieve the saved data. Storing the IV in the database would be counterproductive (similar to storing the combination to a safe under the safe\'s foot), and saving it to the device\'s mass storage would simply be transferring the problem somewhere else (storing the safe combination in the unlocked desk drawer nearby). Secondly, concerning the export/import process, the IV must be something that may be generated on multiple machines; if you are moving your parameters from one device to another, you will obviously want to decrypt the data to import it. A truly random IV would be difficult to deal with in this case, and the user would be required to enter it as well as the password to decrypt the import. Thus, despite the fact that a truly random or pseudo-random IV would offer far superior protection for this encrypted data, we instead use a generated IV in our encryption methods. This IV is generated using various cryptographic hashes, salts, and similar data, so we consider it to be \"good enough\" for most circumstances. However, we point this distinction out so you can decide for yourself if \"good enough\" is good enough for your personal needs.\n\nBecause of the nature of this application, it is strongly recommended that you create a full backup of your site parameters (via the Export feature) any time you make a change. For the highest level of protection, this backup should be stored in a safe place external of your device, even though the data is encrypted. Any number of events may occur to destroy or attempt to modify your saved parameters, such as virus or malware infections, catastrophic storage failures, or even malicious (or incompetent) users. Therefore, a redundant, external, independently encrypted copy of your parameters should be maintained at all times in order to restore your parameters should they become destroyed or unusable. We consider this to be the user\'s responsibility and we cannot be held responsible for your inability or unwillingness to keep such a backup.\n\n<b>Cryptnos</b> is available for multiple platforms. At this time, we cannot guarantee compatibility between the Android version and any other version. In our limited testing, passwords generated by the Android version were identical to passwords generated by other versions, and we believe this will remain the case so long as the underlying text encoding used on both platforms are identical (i.e., you may use Unicode on both systems). Cryptographic hashes operate on binary data, and as long as the inputs are converted into binary and manipulated in the say way, the output should always be identical. If, however, you use one text encoding on your Android device and a different text encoding on another platform, you will likely get incompatible results. Before relying on <b>Cryptnos</b> for password generation on multiple platforms, you should experiment with each version you intend to use and make sure the results are the same.\n\nPrior to <b>Cryptnos</b> 1.1, versions of the program on different platforms used an incompatible, platform-specific export format. Thus, it was impossible to export a set of parameters from <b>Cryptnos</b> on, say, Microsoft Windows and import them into <b>Cryptnos</b> on Android. This has been fixed with <b>Cryptnos</b> 1.1 and later; all versions of the program use the same export format, so you can now share your parameters across platforms. Each platform version retains the ability to read older export files written in the platform-specific formats, so your old backups and exports should still be valid. Handling of these different formats should be relatively transparent. However, it is strongly recommended that these old files be replaced with exports in the new cross-platform format. Old Windows exports still cannot be read by <b>Cryptnos</b> for Android and vice versa; only the Android version will be able to read old Android exports. Replacing your old exports with the new format should guarantee better cross-platform protection in the long term.\n\n<b>Cryptnos</b> uses a number of optional \"conveniences\", such as displaying your unobscured master passwords and copying generated passwords to the clipboard, which may technically increase your risk for intentional or unintentional breaches of data. Such conveniences should only be enabled with care and a full understanding of the risk associated with each one.</string>
<string name="help_text_changelog"><b>Change Log</b>\n\n<b>Version 1.0.0</b>\n\nInitial release\n\n<b>Version 1.1.0</b>\n\nChanged export format to new cross-platform format. Exports from Cryptnos for Android can now be imported into compatible versions of Cryptnos on other platforms. Old 1.0 exports can still be read. 1.1 exports will not be backward compatible with Cryptnos 1.0.\n\nAdded Delete All menu option to the site list. If you enter the Generate Existing, Edit Existing, or Delete menu options from the main menu, the site list appears. Tapping the hardware Menu button will bring up a Delete All menu option, through which you can delete all parameters in the database in one action.\n\nIf OI File Manager is installed, Import and Export will now use that application to assist in selecting import and export file paths. If not available, the original functionality is maintained.\n\n<b>Version 1.2.0</b>\n\nFixed inconsistent internal text encoding issues. Added Advanced Settings activity with option to allow the user to change the text encoding used for most operations. <b>Warning:</b> This <i>may</i> break some users\' data! Users are strongly encouraged to switch to UTF-8 if their device does not already have that as the default.\n\nAdded preferred file manager selection to Advanced Settings activity to support additional third-party file managers. Added AndExplorer as a recognized third-party file manager.\n\nAdded Help option menu to most activity screens.

You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author\'s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors\' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\'s free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\n<b>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</b>\n<b>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</b>\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\'s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients\' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n<b>NO WARRANTY</b>\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n<b>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</b>\n\n<i>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</i>\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n&lt;one line to give the program\'s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\nCopyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\nGnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type \'show w\'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type \'show c\' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands \'show w\' and \'show c\' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than \'show w\' and \'show c\'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program \'Gnomovision\' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989\nTy Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.</string>
