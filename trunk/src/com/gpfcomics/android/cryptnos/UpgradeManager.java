/* UpgradeManager.java
 * 
 * PROGRAMMER:    Jeffrey T. Darlington
 * DATE:          October 22, 2010
 * PROJECT:       Cryptnos (Android)
 * ANDROID V.:	  1.1
 * REQUIRES:      
 * REQUIRED BY:   
 * 
 * This class has been added in Cryptnos 1.2 to handle migration and upgrade changes
 * that may occur between versions.  This was largely not an issue until 1.2, where
 * we decided to force UTF-8 for text encoding wherever possible.  This created the
 * need for a shared preferences file, and a need to keep track of what version we
 * previously ran and which version we're now trying to run.
 * 
 * The idea is to run the UpgradeManager once per session, typically when the main
 * menu is launched for the first time.  When the UpgradeManager is launched, it will
 * load up the preferences file and try to determine the last version of Cryptnos that
 * ran.  If it's the same version as we're currently running, nothing happens.  Cryptnos
 * will remember that the UpgradeManager ran and try not to run it again until the
 * app is garbage collected and restarted.
 * 
 * If the previously run version is less than the current version, we'll perform a
 * series of checks to see what needs to be upgraded, if anything.  These checks are
 * intended to fall into each other, so multiple steps can be performed if needed.
 * Hopefully, this will bring the preferences up to the current version by the end
 * of the series of checks.  Obviously, if the application has never been run before,
 * or if we're coming from a version of Cryptnos prior to creating the preferences
 * file, we'll end up running all the checks as a means of setting up the entire
 * environment.
 * 
 * If the current running version of Cryptnos is less than the version from the
 * preferences file, then the user must have "downgraded".  We won't officially
 * support this scenario and this will throw an error.
 *
 * UPDATES FOR 1.2.1:  Added 1.2.1 version code.  This is a minor update, so it
 * probably isn't even needed.  Still, for completeness, we've added it in.
 * 
 * UPDATES FOR 1.2.2:  Added the 1.2.2 version code, but commented out both it and
 * the 1.2.1 code.  These aren't currently needed but are present primarily for
 * documentation purposes.
 * 
 * UPDATES FOR 1.2.3:  Added the 1.2.3 version code, commented out for now.
 * 
 * UPDATES FOR 1.2.4:  Added the 1.2.4 version code and logic to add the new "copy
 * passwords to clipboard" setting to the shared preferences.
 * 
 * UPDATES FOR 1.2.5:  Added the 1.2.5 version code, commented out for now.
